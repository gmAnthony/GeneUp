# GeneUp

Deployed at [geneup.bio](https://www.geneup.bio)

I made this simple app over the course of a couple days to showcase my ability to create a functional front-end quickly and effectively. There are a number of features that are not yet implemented and I may plan on continuing to work on this just to get it to a fully functional level, depending on availability.

# To-do:
- [ ] Create a "forgot your password" link
- [ ] Send email for account confirmation
- [ ] Add ability to edit projects, orgs, and files
- [ ] Add a detail page or slide-out sidebar for projects, orgs, and files
- [ ] Add ability to sort, filter, and search files
- [ ] Add ability to actually invite members to an organization
- [ ] Add ability to actually share files with other users
- [ ] Add more settings options (password reset, delete account)
